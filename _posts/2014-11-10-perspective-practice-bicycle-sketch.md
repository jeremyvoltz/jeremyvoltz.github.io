I am taking the Perspective Challenge course from Pencil Kings, because in my short time studying drawing, I never really tackled perspective.  It always seemed tedious to me, so I figured I should try to find the fun in it.  My mathematical side does enjoy it's rigor.  

Anyway, here's a gif of a rough bicycle sketch.  The assignment was to try sketching it free hand, then use perspective lines to fix mistakes and draw a more confident sketch.
