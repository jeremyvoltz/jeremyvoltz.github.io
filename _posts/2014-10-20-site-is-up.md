Well, after the hosting of my homepage deleted my account about six months ago, I knew I should probably build another one.  I've been playing around with flask, a python backend for websites, and thought, boy I should build a personal website.  And I really shouldn't use Flask for it!


Flask is great, don't get me wrong, but for a personal site, a static page will be faster to build, faster to load, and faster to edit the content of.  After a lot of hemming and hawing, I decided on github as the host, which means I had to get comfortable with Jekyll.  Jekyll is essentially conversion/templating software for markdown to generate static sites, and it's great!


To get the site off the ground as quickly as possible, I decided to use a pre-built theme.  I settled on [minimal mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) built by [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/).
