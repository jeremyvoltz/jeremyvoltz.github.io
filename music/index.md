I do most of my singing with the fantastic a capella vocal group [Countermeasure](http://www.countermeasuremusic.com), directed by the incredibly talented composer and arranger [Aaron Jensen](http://www.aaronjensen.ca).  

I also perform occasionally around the city of Toronto.  Check out my youtube channel for some live performances, like the following cover of The Allman Brothers song "Whipping Post" at C'est What:

### Original songs

All of these songs were written and recorded in one week as part of /r/songaweek.  So the recording quality isn't always great, as I'm no audio engineer.  I tend to think of these as sketches, that I might come back to and finish someday.

### Covers

I also have a soundcloud playlist of some covers, feel free to give them a listen.
